OMAP HwSpinlock Unit Test
=========================

This repo provides a kernel test module that performs a Linux API
unit-test of the HwSpinlock IP on various TI SoCs. The test exercises
only the Linux-side API, so is not really testing cross-processor
HwSpinlock behavior.


Build:
------
The module is built against a desired Linux kernel. The Linux kernel
should be build with CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK and CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK_OMAP.
CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK is built-in and CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK_OMAP can be
selected to be built-in or as a module

1. Select the following during kernel menuconfig and build the kernel
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Hardware Spinlock drivers -->
        --- Hardware Spinlock drivers
        <M>   OMAP Hardware Spinlock device

2. Build the test module
	export PATH=$PATH:<cross-compiler path>
	make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KERNELDIR=<linux kernel rootdir>


Usage:
------
Steps 1 and 4 not needed if CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK_OMAP=y
	insmod omap_hwspinlock.ko
	insmod omap_hwspinlock_test.ko [count=<num>]
	rmmod omap_hwspinlock_test
	rmmod omap_hwspinlock
